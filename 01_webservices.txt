A webservice is a software system designed to enable communication and interoperability between different applications or systems over a network, typically the internet. It allows disparate systems, written in different programming languages and running on different platforms, to exchange data and invoke functionality seamlessly.


1. **Communication and Interoperability:** Webservices facilitate communication between different software applications or systems, allowing them to exchange data and interact with each other's functionality.

2. **Network-Based:** Webservices operate over a network, often the internet, enabling remote communication between clients and servers.

3. **Platform- and Language-Agnostic:** Webservices are designed to be independent of the underlying platform and programming language. This means that applications written in different languages and running on different platforms can communicate with each other using webservices.

4. **Data Exchange:** Webservices use standardized formats for data exchange, such as XML (eXtensible Markup Language) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), making it easier for systems to understand and process the exchanged information.

5. **Functionality Invocation:** Webservices allow clients to invoke specific functionalities provided by the server, typically through well-defined interfaces and protocols.
